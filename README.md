Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is basically the process of planning, building, testing, and maintaining software to make sure it works well...It is easy to use and meets people's needs. It ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for important applications such as healthcare and finance. It also makes sure that the system can handle an increased load.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Mastering complexity
2. Mastering process
3. Mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Identify the software requirement or purpose and scope 
Requirement analysis - Identify the final user specification 
Design - Building the framework 
Coding - Converting software design into a tangible code 
testing - examin the software for any bugs and glitches 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology which is linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility whereby changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
- Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
- Testing is done at the end of the development process.

Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility which adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
- Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
- Reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
- Create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
- Confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- Analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- Develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.

Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
- Discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
- Create blueprint for the project.
- Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
- Deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software tool that helps programmers write, test, and fix code more easily. It provides a space to write code and includes useful features to make coding faster and easier. Examples include Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
IDE importance: 
- It understands programming rules and helps write correct code.
- It highlights important parts of the code using colors, bold, or italics, making it easier to read.
- It suggests code completions while typing to save time.
- It converts code into a format that computers can understand.
- It allows programmers to test small parts of their code before combining it with others.
- It helps find and fix errors by running the code step by step and highlighting mistakes.
- An IDE makes coding faster, easier, and less error-prone, helping developers build software efficiently.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps programmers track and manage changes to their code over time. It ensures that multiple people can work on the same project without issues. Example: Git.

VCS important?
- Collaboration – Allows multiple developers to work on the same code without conflicts.
- Change Tracking – Keeps a history of changes, making it easy to see what was modified and when.
- Branching & Merging – Lets developers create separate branches for new features and merge them into the main project later.
- Error Recovery – If a mistake happens, developers can easily go back to a previous version of the code.
VCS makes software development  and safe. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1️ Rapid Technological Advancement – Engineers must constantly learn new tools and technologies.
- Solution: Adopt continuous learning and use agile methodologies to stay updated.

2️ Time Constraints – Engineers often work under tight deadlines.
- Solution: Use agile methodologies like Scrum to break projects into smaller, manageable sprints.

3️ Limited Infrastructure – Lack of high-performance tools and computing resources.
- Solution: Invest in robust infrastructure and cloud-based solutions for better performance.

4️ Changing Software Requirements – Frequent updates and modifications make development challenging.
- Solution: Use agile development for adaptability and modular design to allow easy updates.

5️ Software Security – Protecting software from cyber threats is complex.
- Solution: Conduct security research and implement defenses against hacking, malware, and phishing.

6️ Software Accessibility & Usability – Complex software can frustrate users.
- Solution: Focus on scalable architecture and reliable, user-friendly design to improve experience.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting instructions to guide generative AI in producing accurate and relevant responses.

Importance of Prompt Engineering
Improved User Experience – Ensures users get useful results on the first try and reduces biases in AI responses.
Increased Flexibility – Allows the creation of prompts that highlight logical connections and broad patterns without being tied to a specific domain.
Developer Control – Gives developers more control over AI interactions by setting clear intent and context in prompts.
Example of a Vague Prompt and an Improved Version
Vague Prompt: Tell me about history.
Improved Prompt: Give me a summary of major world events from the 20th century, focusing on wars and technological advancements.

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
